🚀 E-commerce Sales Analytics with Power BI & Python 📊

Excited to showcase my latest Data Analytics project, where I analyzed 40,000 records to derive valuable business insights!

📌 Project Overview:
I worked with two datasets:
🔹 Details Dataset – AOV (Average Order Value), Category, Order ID, Payment Mode, Order Quantity.
🔹 Orders Dataset – City, Customer Name, Order Date, Order ID, and State.

🔍 Key Insights Uncovered:
✔ Sales performance by category, city, and state.
✔ Customer purchasing behavior and payment preferences.
✔ Trend analysis of order volume and revenue growth.
✔ Average Order Value (AOV) insights to optimize pricing strategies.

💡 Technologies Used:
✅ Power BI – Interactive dashboards & data visualization.
✅ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data preprocessing, EDA & trend analysis.
✅ SQL & DAX – Data transformation & advanced calculations.
✅ Excel – Data cleaning & structuring.

This project reinforced the power of data-driven decision-making in e-commerce, helping businesses optimize sales and enhance customer experience.
